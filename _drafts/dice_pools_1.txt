I was thinking of using dice pools with 3 basic variations. 1 - unopposed test: used for something where the outcome is in doubt or there is some risk on failure, but no active opposition. A single roll resolves the action or activity. 2 - opposed test: used when there is active resistance, but otherwise same as 1. The number of successes required is modified by half the oppositions pool (rounded down) 3 - consumed pool: used when an extended test is desired for whatever reason - dice are removed from the pool (consumed) based on degree of success of a given opposed or unopposed test. success or failure is determined by whether the pool is totally consumed within a certain number of tests.

Each die having a 50% chance of success is a good idea. d6 or d10 would be my vote for a die type - d10 gives a bit more granularity, but d6 are more commonly available. so on a d6 success would be 4 or greater and on a d10 it would be 6 or greater. With a base obstacle of 2 and a pool of 5 dice that gives about an 80% chance of success. Obstacle of 3 lowers chance of success to about 55%.

To avoid going back and forth, the number of dice in an opponents pool modify the number of successes required. So an opponent with 5 dice in the pool would add 2 to the normal number of successes (this simulates a 50% success rate).

Tests can be modified in a couple of ways - adding dice or changing odds of success for dice. Adding dice should be much more common than changing the odds for each die.

How does exploding dice sound? Dice are said to explode when the top number is rolled, then the die is rolled again and so on, with each counting as a success.

BTW - here is the probability calculator I've been using along with a program for calculating results for this proposal:

[code]
N:=5; \ Change N to alter the number of dice

count 5< N#(accumulate x:=d10 while x=10)
[/code]

Just paste the code above into the box and click calculate probabilities. Results will appear at the bottom of the page.
