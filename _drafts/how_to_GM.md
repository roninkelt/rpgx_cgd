Frame your game - these items will tell you what the focus should be during play. For my typical game the frame is -

*Make the world real.

*Make the characters lives not boring.

*Treat the characters like heroes. 

*Play to find out what happens.

These four sentences frame the game I want to deliver. Verisimilitude is a primary goal. Keep it real and lively is the way I summarize it. Have respect for your players, let them try and succeed or fail on the merits, don't denigrate or let others disrespect their efforts. Uncertainty is a goal, not something to be avoided. Story will come from play, let it happen.

Following on to the frame is the game traits - these are things that should always happen when the occasion demands. They also form the foundation for the player's expectations of you.

In this game I will always:

*Stay Within the Frame 

*Follow the Rules

*Have no Mercy

*Push the Narrative

*Be the Players Conduit into the Game World.

This means that the framing statements are rules, that you have to follow the outcomes of the dice, that you will be true to the conflict questions and push them to the conclusion. Further it encourages you to be generous with the truth and information. (Secrets are there to be discovered.)

And then the meaty Principles (with some short notes on purpose)

 

*Barf Forth Apocalyptica (gritty, dirty verisimilitude)

*Address Yourself to the Characters, not the Players (immersion)

*Make your Move, but Misdirect (immersion)

*Make your Move, but Never Speak Its Name (immersion)

*Look through Crosshairs (be willing to destroy your own stuff)

*Name everyone, make everyone human (no cartoon villains or monsters, everyones sympathetic)

*Ask provocative questions and build on the answers (involve the players in worldbuilding)

*Respond with fuckery and intermittent rewards. (fuckery in this case means to put your own stamp on things, to take what the players give you and twist it and build on it)

*Be a fan of the players characters. (This is such an important rule. I want to see them suffer, but succeed.)

*Think offscreen too. (World building, verisimilitude, future threats)

*Sometimes, disclaim decision making (play to find out what happens).
 

Then the MC has a list of moves, things that you get to do when the players fail a roll or its naturally your turn to do something. Unlike the players moves, these are all narrative concepts, like Offer an opportunity, with or without cost, or Announce future badness.

These are a little more interesting, and I found them a little funny to grasp at first, because up until now, a move has been a player driven roll the dice thing that interfaces with the rules. But the MC moves are all about the rules-narrative feedback loop (what Vincent calls clouds and boxes).

 

Im going to digress here. All rpgs consist of three separate spaces (these are my own terms): the Game-rules space, which includes things like position on a battlemap, hit points remaining, relationship traits, if your game has them, and in game spendable resources (like wealth points or gold coins, in games where shopping matters), the Narrative-space, which includes things like Narrative positioning (Keelers got the high ground, what do you do?), fictional descriptions of things (that wound is gushing out blood), how characters actually feel about each other, and in-setting spendable resources (wealth if your game doesnt have shopping rules). Then theres the Meta-space, which includes things like the relationships and drama between the players, the actual physical setting that the game is played in, and the physical components used to play the games (minis, maps, dice, character sheets).

All roleplaying is a function of feedback loops between these three realms. Something that happens in one realm changes the others. The object of roleplaying games is to use the Rules and Narrative to provide enjoyment on the Meta level.

Roleplaying games focus on the feedback loop between Rules and Narrative. What the mechanics accomplish (in apocalypse world, your PC moves) have narrative consequences. The players push on the game largely with mechanics. The MC pushes back with the narrative.


Firefly Agenda & Principles

 Agenda

Offer kinship, and weigh it with burdens.
Offer liberty, and threaten with power.
Offer independence, and attach strings.
Separate them, surround them, outgun them, but leave them hope.

Principles

(These are heavily influenced by my previous posts about revisiting Firefly.)

Fill the Verse with a diverse cast of characters.
Reflect a bilingual/bicultural Verse, with many other cultures and languages besides.
Apply Chinese cultural markers sparingly, and make them count.
Question: power dynamics, resources and control.
Refresh: stories, histories, parallels, narratives.
Reveal: different people end up in similar circumstances and problems.
Avoid: orientalism and other weird old problematic emergent tropes.

Apocalypse World On Running a Game:

There are a million ways to GM games; Apocalypse World calls for one way in particular. this chapter is it. Follow these as rules.  the whole rest of the game is built upon this.

AGENDA
 Make Apocalypse World seem real.
 Make the players characters lives not boring.
 Play to find out what happens.
Everything you say, you should do it to accomplish these three, and no other. Its not, for instance, your agenda to make the players lose, or to deny them what they want, or to punish them, or to control them, or to get them through your pre-planned storyline (DO NOT pre-plan a storyline, and Im not fucking around). Its not your job to put their characters in double-binds or dead ends, or to yank the rug out from under their feet. Go chasing after any of those, youll wind up with a boring game that makes Apocalypse World seem contrived, and youll be pre-deciding what happens by yourself, not playing to find out.
Play to find out: theres a certain discipline you need in order to MC Apocalypse World. You have to commit yourself to the games fictions own internal logic and causality, driven by the players characters. You have to open yourself to caring what happens, but when it comes time to say what happens, you have to set what you hope for aside.
the reward for MCing, for this kind of GMing, comes with the discipline. When you find something you genuinely care about  a question about what will happen that you genuinely want to find out  letting the games fiction decide it is uniquely satisfying.

ALWAYS SAY
 What the principles demand (as follow).
 What the rules demand.
 What your prep demands.
 What honesty demands.
Apocalypse World divvies the conversation up in a strict and pretty traditional way. the players job is to say what their characters say and undertake to do, first and exclusively; to say what their characters think, feel and remember, also exclusively; and to answer your questions about their characters lives and surroundings. Your job as MC is to say everything else: everything about the world, and what everyone in the whole damned world says and does except the players characters.
Always be scrupulous, even generous, with the truth. the players depend on you to give them real information they can really use, about their characters surroundings, about whats happening when and where. Same with the games rules: play with integrity and an open hand. the players are entitled to the full benefits of their moves, their rolls, their characters strengths and resources. Dont chisel them, dont weasel, dont play gotcha.
If youre playing the game as the players adversary, your decision-making responsibilities and your rules-oversight constitute a conflict of interests. Play the game with the players, not against them.

THE PRINCIPLES
 Barf forth apocalyptica.
 Address yourself to the characters, not the players.
 Make your move, but misdirect.
 Make your move, but never speak its name.
 Look through crosshairs.
 Name everyone, make everyone human.
 Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
 Respond with fuckery and intermittent rewards.
 Be a fan of the players characters.
 think offscreen too.
 Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.
 Barf forth apocalyptica. Cultivate an imagination full of harsh landscapes, garish bloody images, and grotesque juxtapositions.
In Apocalypse World, when the rain falls its full of fine black grit like toner, and all the plants leaves turn gray from absorbing it.  Out among the wrecked cars, wild dogs fight for territory, with each other and with the rats, and one of the breeds is developing a protective inner eyelid of blank bone. If you get too close to them you can hear the click-click when they blink.
 Address yourself to the characters, not the players. Marie, where are you this morning? not Julia, wheres Marie this morning? A woman comes up to you, her names Pelt, and shes anxious to get back to her family. Its obvious she is. Its obvious she is makes this something the character knows and sees in Pelt, not exposition straight from you to the player.
 Make your move, but misdirect. Of course the real reason why you choose a move exists in the real world. Somebody has her character go someplace new, somebody misses a roll, somebody hits a roll that calls for you to answer, everybodys looking to you to say something, so you choose a move to make.
Real-world reasons. However, misdirect: pretend that youre making your move for reasons entirely within the games fiction instead. Maybe your move is to separate them, for instance; never say you missed your roll, so you two get separated.
Instead, maybe say you try to grab his gun  this was the PCs move  but he kicks you down. While theyre stomping on you, they drag Damson away. the effects the same, theyre separated, but youve cannily misrepresented the cause. Make like its the games fiction that chooses your move for you, and so correspondingly always choose a move that the games fiction makes possible.
 Make your move, but never speak its name. Maybe your move is to separate them, but you should never just say that. Instead, say how Fosters thugs drags one of them off, and Foster invites the other to eat lunch with her. Maybe your move is to announce future badness, but for god sake never say the words future badness. Instead, say how this morning, filthy, stinking black smoke is rising from somewhere in the car yard, and I wonder
whats brewing over there?
these two principles are cause and effect. the truth is that youve chosen a move and made it. Pretend, though, that theres a fictional cause; pretend that it has a fictional effect.
Together, the purpose of these two principles is to create an illusion for the players, not to hide your intentions from them.
Certainly never to hide your NPCs actions, or developments in the characters world, from the players characters! No; always say what honesty demands. When it comes to whats happening to and around the players characters, always be as honest as you can be.
Your MC moves are not at all the same thing as the players moves. Ill list your moves and tell you how to choose one in just a sec.
 Look through crosshairs. Whenever your attention lands on someone or something that you own  an NPC or a feature of the landscape, material or social  consider first killing it, overthrowing it, burning it down, blowing it up, or burying it in the poisoned ground. An individual NPC, a faction of NPCs, some arrangement between NPCs, even an entire rival holding and its NPC warlord: crosshairs. Its one of the games slogans: there are no status quos in Apocalypse World. You can let the players think that some arrangement or institution is reliable, if theyre that foolish, but for you yourself: everything you own is, first, always and overwhelmingly, a target.
 Name everyone, make everyone human. the first step toward making your NPCs seem real is to name them. theres a list of good NPC names on the 1st session worksheet, and feel free to scavenge unused names from the character playbooks too. Every NPC who gets even a single line or a single significant on-screen action, give a name.
Make your NPCs human by giving them straightforward, sensible self-interests. Take Roark, one of my favorite NPCs.  Roark comes back from burning down the neighboring hold, unleashing chaos upon us all, and hes beaming because hes really just not that complicated. He wanted to burn it down, so he did, and now he wants a bubble bath because hes all sooty, and thats his entire deal. In your game, make all your NPCs just not that complicated. they do what they want to do, when they want to do it, and if something gets in their way, well, they deal with that now. What they do in life is follow their parts around  their noses, their stomachs, their hearts, their clits & dicks, their guts, their ears, their inner children, their visions.
then, you can make PCNPCPC triangles  and make your NPCs even more human  just by making sure that their uncomplicated self-interests involve the players characters individually, not as a group. Show different sides of their personalities to the players different characters. Roark loves Marie, who has ambitions, but he serves Uncle, who wants people in their places. Roark goes to Uncle to boast, to Bish to feel superior, to Marie for bubble baths. Foster wants to overthrow Uncle and take his holding, but would prefer everyone else  Bish, Marie, Damson, Dune  to stay on under her rule. these are the kinds of triangles that give the players characters something to talk about.
 Ask provocative questions and build on the answers. Start simple: Whats your living space like? Whos known each other longest? But as play proceeds, ask for immediate and intimate details of the characters experiences. In his playtest, Mikael made himself a list of question prompts: Feeling, Sound, Detail: thing, thoughts, Pose, Smell, Need, Irritant, Texture, In sight, Relations, Taste, Detail: place. they led him to ask questions like Why can you only fit two people in the cabin of the Tank? How do the people of the Tent City make you feel? How do her lips feel under your palm? Very good stuff.
Once you have the players answer, build on it. I mean three things by that: (1) barf apocalyptica upon it, by adding details and imagery of your own; (2) refer to it later in play, bringing it back into currency; and (3) use it to inform your own developing apocalyptic aesthetic, incorporating it  and more importantly, its implications  into your own vision.
Its especially important to ask, the first time each character opens her brain to the worlds psychic maelstrom, what thats like for her. Maybe its the same for everybody, maybe its different. And after the first time, always, always add details of your own.
 Respond with fuckery and intermittent rewards. As in fuck around with, not fuck over. this is like when you barf apocalyptica onto someones answer, but do it all the time. How about an example?
Marie makes it super clear to Roark that she doesnt care who he kills, but hes to bring Joes Girl (an NPC) back to her alive. For questioning or examination or something  Marie wants access to Joes Girls living brain. So Roark goes out, murders a batch of people, and comes back with Joes Girl alive. Heres where I fuck around, though: hes beaten the SHIT out of her.
Marie has access to her brain (because always give the characters what they work for) but shes in a coma, her back is broken, her face is smashed in. Joes Girl is alive for now, but ruined for good.  I gave Marie what she worked for, but not really what she hoped for. See it? throw curves. Put your bloody fingerprints all over everything you touch.
Intermittently, though, right, give one of the players characters exactly what she hoped for, and maybe go a little beyond. Do it just enough, and not when they expect it, so that they always hope that this time is one of the times that itll work out. A third of the time? Half? Not rare, just not predictable.
 Be a fan of the players characters. Make the characters lives not boring does not mean always worse. Sometimes worse, sure, of course. Always? Definitely not.
the worst way there is to make a characters life more interesting is to take away the things that made the character cool to begin with. the gunluggers guns, but also the gunluggers collection of ancient photographs  what makes the character match our expectations and also what makes the character rise above them. Dont take those away.
the other worst way is to deny the character success when the characters fought for it and won it. Always give the characters what they work for! No, the way to make a characters success interesting is to make it consequential. When a character accomplishes something, have all of your NPCs respond. Reevaluate all those PCNPCPC triangles youve been creating. Whose needs change? Whose opinions change? Who was an enemy, but now is afraid; who was an enemy, but now sees better opportunities as an ally? Let the characters successes make waves outward, let them topple the already unstable situation. there are no status quos in Apocalypse World! Even life doesnt always suck.
Make as hard and direct a move as you like means just that.  As hard and direct as you like. It doesnt mean make the worst move you can think of. Apocalypse World is already out to get the players characters. So are the games rules. If you, the MC, are out to get them too, theyre plain fucked.
this goes for highlighting stats, too. When you highlight a characters stats, try to choose one thatll show off who the character is. Switch up often  for certain dont just choose the lowest stat and stick with it  and try to make sure that the character usually has at least one high stat highlighted.
 think offscreen too. When its time for you to make a move, imagine what your many various NPCs must have been doing meanwhile. Have any of them done something offscreen that now becomes evident? Are any of them doing things offscreen that, while invisible to the players characters, deserve your quiet notice? this is part of making Apocalypse World seem real  and if you pay attention to your fronts, its part of making the characters lives not boring too.
 Sometimes, disclaim decision-making. In order to play to find out what happens, youll need to pass decision-making off sometimes. Whenever something comes up that youd prefer not to decide by personal whim and will, dont. the game gives you four key tools you can use to disclaim responsibility: you can put it in your NPCs hands, you can put it in the players hands, you can create a countdown, or you can make it a stakes question.
Say that theres an NPC whose life the players have come to care about, for instance, and you dont feel right about just deciding when and whether to kill her off:
You can (1) put it in your NPCs hands. Just ask yourself, in this circumstance, is Birdie really going to kill her? If the answers yes, she dies. If its no, she lives. Yes, this leaves the decision in your hands, but it gives you a way to make it with integrity.
You can (2) put it in the players hands. For instance, Dous been shot, yeah, shes shuddering and going into shock. What do you do? If the character helps her, she lives; if the character doesnt or cant, she dies. You could even create a custom move for it, if you wanted, to serve the exact circumstances. See the moves snowball chapter, page 151, and the advanced fuckery chapter, page 267.
You can (3) create a countdown. See the countdown section in the fronts chapter, page 143. Just sketch a quick countdown clock. Mark 9:00 with she gets hurt, 12:00 with she dies.
Tick it up every time she goes into danger, and jump to 9:00 if shes in the line of fire. this leaves it in your hands, but gives you a considered and concrete plan, instead of leaving it to your whim.
Or you can (4) make it a stakes question. See the stakes section in the fronts chapter, page 145.Will Dou live through all this?
Now youve promised yourself not to just answer it yourself, yes or no, she lives or she dies. Whenever it comes up, you must give the answer over to your NPCs, to the players characters, to the games moves, or to a countdown, no cheating.
So those are the principles.:
 Barf forth apocalyptica.
 Address yourself to the characters, not the players.
 Make your move, but misdirect.
 Make your move, but never speak its name.
 Look through crosshairs.
 Name everyone, make everyone human.
 Ask provocative questions and build on the answers.
 Respond with fuckery and intermittent rewards.
 Be a fan of the players characters.
 think offscreen too.
 Sometimes, disclaim decision-making.
Whenever someone turns and looks to you to say something, always say what the principles demand.

YOUR MOVES
 Separate them.
 Capture someone.
 Put someone in a spot.
 Trade harm for harm (as established).
 Announce off-screen badness.
 Announce future badness.
 Inflict harm (as established).
 Take away their stuff.
 Make them buy.
 Activate their stuffs downside.
 Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
 Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost.
 Turn their move back on them.
 Make a threat move (from one of your fronts).
 After every move: what do you do?
Whenever theres a pause in the conversation and everyone looks to you to say something, choose one of these things and say it. they arent technical terms or jargon: announce future badness, for instance, means think of something bad thats probably going to happen in the future, and announce it. Make them buy means the thing they want? theyre looking to you to tell them if they can have it? If they want it, they have to buy it.
And so on.
then, what do you do?
Remember the principles. Remember to address yourself to the characters, remember to misdirect, and remember to never speak your moves name. Say what happens to the characters as though it were their world thats the real one.
Here are guidelines for choosing your moves:
Always choose a move that can follow logically from whats going on in the games fiction. It doesnt have to be the only one, or the most likely, but it does have to make at least some kind of sense.
Generally, limit yourself to a move thatll (a) set you up for a future harder move, and (b) give the players characters some opportunity to act and react. A start to the action, not its conclusion.
However, when a players character hands you the perfect opportunity on a golden plate, make as hard and direct a move as you like. Its not the meaner the better, although mean is often good.
Best is: make it irrevocable.
When a players character makes a move and the player misses the roll, thats the cleanest and clearest example there is of an opportunity on a plate. When youve been setting something up and it comes together without interference, that counts as an opportunity on a plate too.
But again, unless a players character has handed you the opportunity, limit yourself to a move that sets up future moves, your own and the players characters.
the most important and versitile setup move is announce future badness. If you dont have another move already at hand, announce future badness:
Someones in there, you hear them moving. What do you do?
Oh, hey, Keeler, Ribs is looking for you. What do you do?
Shes about to figure out where you are. What do you do?
Dude you have a split second before that thing gets its teeth into your arm. What do you do?
Hey boss, its cool, but I dont think everybodys happy. thereve been more fights down in the stews, I think somebodys maybe trying to move in on somebody elses biz. What do you do?
You hear a dog outside, sniffing and whining. You found something, boy? What do you do?
Announcing off-screen badness is good too. After all, badness elsewhere now will usually become badness here later:
You hear gunfire, not too far away. Maybe Hisons people, hard to know. What do you do?
Sometime in the night, an explosion wakes you all up. Its not in the holding, but its nearby. Everything shakes. What do you do?
Whats up this morning? Oh yeah, I remember. theres a pillar of black smoke on the horizon, and if you look through binoculars you can see refugees. What do you do?
EXAMPLES OF MC MOVES
 Separate them.
Oh, hold on, youre far enough apart by now that you cant hear each other. What do you do instead?
Keeler, you get back, but Wilson, youre still out dealing with the gasoline tribe. Keeler, wanna do anything while you wait?
 Capture someone.
Dremmers gang takes cover all around, it looks like theyre settling in for a seige. Pop your head out and theyll take a shot at it. What do you do?
When you get up to go, she throws herself in front of the door.  What do you do?
 Put someone in a spot.
Bran, youre walking between the poor stalls in the marketplace and you see Ribs coming toward you. Glance around, her people are closing in behind and to the sides. What do you do?
You and Whychurch are neck and neck, but the roadway on your left is broken and jagged and he keeps grinding his truck against your right, to push you over there. What do you do?
 Trade harm for harm (as established).
You make it to cover behind the fallen wall. At least one of Dremmers people went down, but you took a solid bullet yourself on the way, for 2-harm. Youre bleeding and having trouble breathing, what do you do?
In the scramble, he manages to nail you with his elbow, right in the armored corset, for 0-harm, and he manages to cut his hand wide open on your scalpel
 Inflict harm (as established).
Oh jesus, Wilson, theyve got a sharpshooter above you. You find out about it when Mamo grunts and sits down hard, and doesnt move again. What do you do?
For the details of trading and inflicting harm, see the harm & healing chapter, page 159.
 Take away their stuff.
Youre walking out to your car, right? One of Dremmers guys is fucking standing on the roof, holding an assault rifle. Hison, maybe his name is. What do you do?
So of course they kick in your door while you and Amni are hot at it. Youre naked, they kick your guns out of the way. theyre putting their crowbars in your face and Amnis screaming
 Make them buy.
So Keeler, youve just resupplied on ammo with Grammer  thats 1-barter  and as youre leaving
Jangry keeps you good and narcostabbed for like 3 days, and you come out of it at 6:00 on your harm countdown. thatll be 3-barter and thats the friends rate, she says
 Activate their stuffs downside.
Shes too close for you to bring your rifle to bear, shes right on top of you. She has a hatchet made out of, like, a meat cleaver lashed onto the back of a claw hammer. What do you do instead?
 Tell them the possible consequences and ask.
You go out there, youre completely exposed, you realize that, right? Do you go?
Yes, you can push on to Hatchet City if you want, but youll be below E when you get there. You wont be able to leave again if something goes wrong. Is that still what you do?
 Offer an opportunity, with or without a cost.
You dont think he knows youre there yet. You can get the drop on him, if you dont mind leaving Amni here. Wanna?
Oh man, the looks theyre giving each other, they are not happy about this. this would be a perfect time to press them. Do you?
 Turn their move back on them.
Hisons standing on Keelers car, and rather than just shoot him off, Keeler decides to play it safe and read the sitch. Her player blows the roll, though. Ask me questions anyway, I say. But if you act on my answers, you get no bonus, and if you dont, you get -1. 
 Make a threat move (from one of your fronts).
See the threats section of the fronts chapter, page 138.
RULES AND YOUR PREP
the games rules will tell you things to say. When a players character goes aggro on someone and the player rolls 79, for instance, the rules give you a list of things to choose from.
Choose one of them, and thats what you say. Say it according to the principles as always. For instance, for they get the hell out of your way: she dives into the mucky ditch and elbowcrawls away. Or, for they give you what you want: she puts the night-vision goggles down in front of you. Fine, I didnt realize you needed em so fucking bad, she says. But dont come over tonight, asshole, swear to god.
Your fronts will tell you things to say, too. When a players character opens her brain to the worlds psychic maelstrom, for instance, the rules might tell you to reveal something interesting.
Something interesting? Look to your fronts: Joes Girl has joined the water cult, Ill bet they didnt know that. So say that, and of course say it according to the principles. Maybe deep under the brain-howling, you come to hear  is it chanting? A list of peoples names, chanted over and over by a hundred subliminal voices. Tum Tum  Gnarly  Fleece  Lala  Forner  Joes Girl  Shan  (Player: wait, Joes Girl? Shit FUCK.)
A FEW MORE THINGS TO DO
these arent principles or moves. theyre just good practice and I recommend them.
Make maps like crazy. Have the players make maps like crazy too. And sketches, and diagrams, and any kind of ephemera that seems good.
Turn questions back on the asker or over to the group at large.
Good question, actually. What does the rag-waste outside the holding look like?
Digress occasionally. Include details sometimes as though you were looking idly at a scene and some detail, something not at all the point, caught your attention. Shes pinned rat furs to her wall. the pins are, like, souvenir push pins, the heads are tiny glass lenses with pictures of national monuments under them.
Mount Rushmore, the Lincoln Memorial
Elide the action sometimes, and zoom in on its details other times. Play out a battle in precise and exacting detail, but in the middle of it say so they keep you both pinned down there until nightfall. Sometimes pick one session up in the moments where the last left off, other times let days or weeks pass in between.
this goes for moves, too. Making a dash under fire might mean crossing 3 meters of open ground in view of one of Dremmers snipers, it might mean crossing 100 meters of broken ground with his gang arrayed thereupon, it might mean crossing the whole damned burn flat with Dog Head and his grinning-dingo cannibals in pursuit. Let the moves expand and contract in time, all through the range from their smallest logical limit to their greatest.
Go around the table. Over the course of a session, make sure that everybody gets some good dedicated screen time. While this is going on, Dune, where are you? What are you doing? When interesting things are happening simultaneously, cut back and forth between them.
Take breaks and take your time. Breaks are important, they let everybody reflect on whats happened and plan a little about what their characters might do next. Little breaks in play when someone elses character is on screen, longer play-stopping breaks for tea cigs or pee, breaks between sessions, even taking a whole session off now and then. A player worn out and at a loss now, after a break might have great ideas and enthusiasm. Better to call a break early, even, than to go past anyones endurance.



players have it easy. they have these fun little books to go through and then theyre ready to play. Your job is harder, you have a lot more to set up than they do. they each have one character to create, you have the whole bedamned world.
So lets be fair. You have the whole world to create, you get the whole first session to create it in. Youre supposed to make their characters lives not boring, you get a whole session to get to know them.
BEFORE THE 1ST SESSION:
Print and assemble a set of the character playbooks. Read them if you havent! theyre the core of the game. Print a 1st session worksheet, an MC playsheet and a front sheet.
Read this whole book. You can skim the chapters on the characters moves and crap, theyre for reference during character creation and later, but do skim them at least. Read the rest as carefully as you can.
Familiarize yourself with the rules for creating fronts, but DO NOT create one.
Daydream some apocalyptic imagery, but DO NOT commit yourself to any storyline or particular characters.

DURING THE 1ST SESSION:
Oversee character creation. Answer questions. Open this book to the character creation chapter but put bookmarks in the characters moves and crap chapters.
Go around for introductions, do the Hx thing, highlight stats.
then Id just say it outright to your players: your setups easy and now youve already done it. Mines harder so Im going to take this whole session to do it. So no high-tension kick off from me, lets follow the characters around for a day and get to know them. Cool?
A couple of you groaned, I could hear you from way over here.
Oh great, getting to know the characters, thats a recipe for will anything ever happen? Following the characters around for a day and getting to know them, it could mean establishing a whole unwieldy mass of status quo, right?
It could mean that but it doesnt. Say it with me: there are no status quos in Apocalypse World.
What it means instead: its your job to create a fractured, tilting landscape of inequalities, incompatible interests, PC-NPC-PC triangles, untenable arrangements. A dynamic opening situation, not a status quo youre going to have to put your shoulder against and somehow shift, like pushing a futon up a ladder. No: an unstable mass, already charged with potential energy and ready to split and slide, not a mass at rest.
Heres how.
First and always, do everything it says to do in the master of ceremonies chapter (page 107). this is crucial. Lets just follow the characters around for a day  in Apocalypse World, thats automatically dangerous. Its automatically a bad day.
Just because its the first session, whatever, youre still actually playing the game.
 MC the game. Bring it.
But especially do these:
 Describe. Barf forth apocalyptica.
 Springboard off character creation.
 Ask questions like crazy.
 Leave yourself things to wonder about.
 Look for where theyre not in control.
 Push there.
 Nudge the players to have their characters make moves.
 Give every character good screen time with other characters.
 Leap forward with named, human NPCs.
 Hell, have a fight.
 Fill up your 1st session worksheet.

 Describe. Barf forth apocalyptica. You already have a lot of good material to work with. Everything the players have come up with between them and introduced at the end of character creation, plus everything Ive given you, plus the stuff you thought about yourself before the game.
Talk about the landscape, the sky, the people, their broken lives.
Say what the weathers like, say what time of day, say what the walls look like, what the rag-waste smells like, how the plastic canvasses snap and hiss, how many people are at the well and which of them have guns.
Say everything, and remember to
 Springboard off character creation. the players characters are made of interesting details you can build on. Look at the hardholders gigs, for instance: each of those gigs has people responsible for it, crews that answer to the hardholder and have names and relationships and all kinds of loose ends. Name everyone! Make everyone human! Look at the Choppers gang, the operators crew, the hocus followers. Look at what the players created when they were doing Hx with each other. Look at where they come from and what must be around them.
Look closely, but you cant know everything, so
 Ask questions like crazy. Ask about the landscape, the sky, the people and their broken lives too, dont just tell, share. Turn a players question over to the group: I dont know, where DO you get your food?
But especially, anything you want to know, ask. Anything you think might be interesting later, ask. Anything a player says that sticks out, anything that seems like the tip of an iceberg, or like fish moving under water, ask. Start to cultivate an apocalyptic aesthetic in your players too.
Ask questions, but also
 Leave yourself things to wonder about. Youll know it when it happens. A player will say something and youll be like, hey wait, there are fish swimming down there. So youll ask, and the player will answer, but youll be like I dont think thats the fish Im after. I think the fish Im after is still down there, deeper than I thought, and bigger than I thought too.
Sometimes itll happen with one of your own NPCs. Youll be talking along, and youll suddenly be like, hold on, this guy Scrimp is kind of a weasely fuck, but he isnt afraid of Marie at all. How can that be?
You dont need an explanation right now! Dont look too deep, this is just session 1. Nod to yourself and back away, fixing the spot in your memory. (Which means to note it down on your worksheet under I wonder.)
Dont explain everything, but do
 Look for where theyre not in control. If yours are like mine, theyll want to be in control of everything, all tidy and secure. Of course they cant be. Whats on their perimeter, on their borders, their horizon? What reaches into their little slice of world, what passes through it? What does it depend upon? Who do they need, and who else needs what they have?
I wonder what theyll do when their neighbors get hungry. I wonder what theyll do when the weather goes wrong. I wonder what theyd do to protect their well. I wonder what will happen when Dog Head stops taking orders from Keeler. I wonder what would happen if Bran couldnt get power to his weirdshop.
And
 Push there. the MC move for pushing is announce future badness. Wilson, youre down collecting the days water from the well and do you feel like reading a charged situation?
Something seems off this morning. Keeler, Dog Head does what you say, but, its like, he keeps looking at you for a minute after you give him the order. What do you do? Bran, while youre working, just for a few seconds all your lights dim and the constant low hum of your workspace? You hear it just start to slow. Everything kicks back in after just a second or two and you can keep working. What do you do?
 Nudge the players to have their characters make moves.
Start with the characters with beginning-of-session moves: the hardholder, the operator, the hocus, the savvyhead, if youve got them. thats now, the first beginning of the first session. Have them make those moves and follow what happens.
then throughout the session, remind everyone to look at their character sheets to see what moves they might make. Especially, listen in on the characters conversations. As soon as you hear a note of tension, jump in and have everybody read everybody.
So that was kind of a sharp thing to say. Anybody want to read anybody? Situations too: hey, this situation seems kind of charged to me. Want to read it?
 Give every character good screen time with other characters.
Bring them onscreen in pairs and triples, in obvious groupings and unlikely ones too. Play with their natural hierarchies and bring them into circumstances where they might have something to say to each other. Here are a few ways you can do it:
Build on what the players said when they introduced their characters. So Keeler, Marie, you two have this raiding thing out on the wilderness road, where Marie stands lookout and Keeler attacks travelers in the night? Lets see that. Its before dawn
Invent bad news for one character to give to another. Marie, youre walking past the armory (Keeler, youre in charge of the armory, of course) and you notice the locks been smashed off.  What do you do?
Make a pairing or tripling that you like, then ask the players to justify it. Marie, Bran, you two are trapped outside of the holding, youre hunkered down inside an old gutted RV. Outside, six of Dremmers gang are setting up camp, looks like theyre settling in. they dont know youre there, they just blundered in on top of you. What are you two doing out here, anyway?
 Leap forward with named, human NPCs. Just choose a name from the list on your worksheet or make one up.
Heres Shreyas about names: In Apocalypse World, its like they have cultural references without the cultural referents.  they dont know what a mother superior is, so they think its reasonable to name the baby it.
Remember how to make NPCs human? Give them straightforward, understandable self-interests. Choose a body part  their stomach, their gut, their dick or clit, their nose, their time-ticking womb, their fearful cowardly heart (or their generous caring heart, or their bold big heart)  and have them just follow it around wherever it goes.
Scrimp comes into the room. Hes been out scouting and he has something urgent to tell you, Keeler, but he gets distracted. He looks at all three of you and hes got this look. Jesus, you know hes speculating which of you might let him show you his dick.
And as always, use them to make PC-NPC-PC triangles: He seems to come to a decision. Hes like, hey Marie, hows it? Or can I call you Madam Miss Hot Bitch Baby? Keelers player:
You said he has something urgent to tell me? Me: He sure does, but right now hes making his smoothest on Marie. Hey Keeler Sweet Stuff, wait in line, you can have me for leftovers. Keelers player: is this guy useful? Will somebody miss him?
 Hell, have a fight. Just because its the first session doesnt mean you cant.
Heres a fun thing to do: Keeler, this person named III corners you that night. Shes fucking pissed off, she comes straight at you, fists first. What did you do to her?
Maybe Keelers player will answer with something. Dude, sure, Ive been sleeping with her guy. Great! Away you go. Or maybe shell say what? Nothing. I dont know. thats cool too, must be a case of mistaken identity. Maybe Dog Head stole a can of pineapple from III but she thinks that Keeler did it. Say, great!  You dont know why. Here she comes, though. What do you do? Just keep all your NPCs motivations simple and you can have them do whatever you want, fights included.
Save the big deal fighting until you have a whole front to back it up, though. I dont recommend that you have the rival gang invade now, for instance. For the first session, keep the fights down to maybe 1-on-1 and 2-on-2. I also dont recommend the optional battle moves for the first session, strongly, absolutely.
Have it out with just basic moves: reading the sitch, going aggro, seizing by force, acting under fire.
 Fill up your 1st session worksheet. List the players characters in the center circle. think of the space around them as a map, but with scarcity and lack instead of cardinal directions. As you name NPCs, place them on the map around the PCs, according to the fundamental scarcity that makes them a threat to the PCs.
Like take the example 1st session worksheet opposite. Fosters a threat to the PCs because of her envy. When Brans crew or Uncles raiders are a threat to the PCs, its because of their ambition or their hunger, respectively. the burn flats are a threat to anyone who goes out there; I listed it somewhere between thirst and ignorance because they both sounded right. And the water cult is threatening because of decay, because of the decay it represents.
While youre there, put down a quick couple-word description or any other notes you need, so you dont forget what you meant.
theres also a place to list things you wonder about.
