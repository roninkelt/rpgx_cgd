Let it Ride

dice rolls in this game are not intended to represent a single action but rather a characters best efforts. If after a roll the character does not succeed they may not roll again to attempt the same action and intent. Another roll is not allowed unless there is a significant change in intent or situation.

For example - a character intends to burst through a door and into the room beyond. They roll poorly and the door resists their best efforts. The character may not reroll the attempt unless they change the intent - perhaps from bursting through the door to picking the lock - or situation - another character notices a crowbar or fire extinguisher that may be used as a tool.  In this example, perhaps the GM may impose a -1 or -2 on the roll for picking the lock due to damage caused by the attempt to break it open, or a +1 or +2 to the attempt to break it open using a tool due to the nature of the tool and damage the door has already sustained.
