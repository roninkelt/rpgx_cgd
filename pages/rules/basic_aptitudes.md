##Basic Aptitudes

**physical** - deals with physical movement and strength, kinaesthetic sense, balance

**mental** - abilities in the complex acquisition, formation and processing of information. Thinking symbolically and reasoning abstractly fall under this category, as does the ability to create conceptual verbal patterns. think logically; inductively, and to some degree deductively; categorically; to recognize patterns, both geometric and numerical; as well as the ability to see and work with abstract concepts.

**social** - deals with the ability to be somewhat insulated from ones peers; to have a strong sense of self; to have leadership abilities in reference to making decisions that may not be popular with others. This strong sense of self creates a certain amount of immunity from peer pressure. May be described as "loners". intuitive feelings, inner wisdom.

**mystical** - sensing patterns in and making connections to elements in magic or spiritual realms.
