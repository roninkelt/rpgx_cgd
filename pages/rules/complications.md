#Complications

Any Test that has a Degree of exactly zero gives the GM license to introduce Complications.

Complications should be introduced quickly by the referee, and have at least tenuous connection with the task which created the Complication. 

Complications are a challenge to the referee to introduce additional [obstacles](../obstacle/index.html) or [conflicts](../conflict/index.html) to the narrative.

A complication should raise tension, suspense or emotional intensity for a character or story. They do this by introducing obstacles, reversals, confrontations or increasing the consequences of failure or success. Complications should do these things in small steps.
