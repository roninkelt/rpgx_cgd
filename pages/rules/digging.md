Digging A Hole

This is the concept of accepting failure now to build for dramatic success in the future. It allows players to bank dice in a community pool for future use by accpeting failure and complication in the immediate circumstances.

When faced with a Test, players can accept failure and a complication rather than make a roll in order to add a die to a community pool of dice that may be drawn upon at a later time. Players can draw from the pool during any test and in any amount of dice.
