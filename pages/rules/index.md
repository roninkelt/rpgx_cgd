This game is intended to be most useful for forum games - those that take place via forum post or email. The intention is to take advantage of that format's strengths - detailed character &amp; storybuilding - and minimize the weaknesses - long time lag and sudden dropout of participants.  It's also intended to be used at the tabletop with minimal modification and will have designers notes on suggestions for use in tabletop play.

In addition, we'll just be presenting a game framework. Settings will be defined separately. The game framework will be flexible enough to encompass many different settings with a similar play style.

The bigger picture

This is a participatory game, players are expected and encouraged to have at least as much input on story direction as is the GM. To that end, creating conflict is the most important goal of the GM. Story, theme and any number of other deeper subjects will emerge from the interaction of the players and the conflict. 

the goal of the system is to tell an interesting story that is entertaining for the participants, the content will be dependent on what is agreed as appropriate by everyone involved. Heroes, Anti Heroes, Villains and everyday Joes are all within the scope of this game. It's something that should be worked out before play begins.
