This game is intended to be most useful for forum games - those that take place via forum post or email. The intention is to take advantage of that format\'s strengths - detailed character &amp; storybuilding - and minimizes the weaknesses - long time lag and sudden dropout of participants.  It's also intended to be used at the tabletop with minimal modification and will have designers notes on suggestions for use in tabletop play.

In addition, we'll just be presenting a game framework. Settings will be defined separately. The game framework will be flexible enough to encompass many different settings with a similar play style.
