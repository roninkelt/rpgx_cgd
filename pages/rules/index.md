This game is intended to be most useful for forum games - those that take place via forum post or email. The intention is to take advantage of that format's strengths - detailed character &amp; storybuilding - and minimize the weaknesses - long time lag and sudden dropout of participants.  It's also intended to be used at the tabletop with minimal modification and will have designers notes on suggestions for use in tabletop play.

In addition, we'll just be presenting a game framework. Settings will be defined separately. The game framework will be flexible enough to encompass many different settings with a similar play style.

The bigger picture

This is a participatory game, players are expected and encouraged to have at least as much input on story direction as is the GM. To that end, creating conflict is the most important goal of the GM. Story, theme and any number of other deeper subjects will emerge from the interaction of the players and the conflict. 

the goal of the system is to tell an interesting story that is entertaining for the participants, the content will be dependent on what is agreed as appropriate by everyone involved. Heroes, Anti Heroes, Villains and everyday Joes are all within the scope of this game. It's something that should be worked out before play begins.

#Running the Game


##Defining the bounds/The Social Contract
honest discussion about creative agenda   
types of conflict   
acceptable materials   
expectations for play   
How long is this going to take  - be specific 

##Defining Conflicts & Stakes

##Story Threads
the narrative tree - start with conflict at the trunk, let the players help develop and explore the branches

Story Choice is feedback. The players give feedback via the choices they make in game, listen and home in on those things that they find interesting. Encourage meaningful choice as opposed to false choice, give players agency in the story.

##Creating A Game
Talk to potential players about the big questions in the game. Have players talk to each other about characters and how they address these questions.
