#Obstacles

Things that are hard to accomplish. Obstacles are external problems that the character can tackle without facing any internal difficulty. They may include such things as:

* Sneaking past a guard
* Walking a high wire.
* Jumping from roof to roof.
* Picking a lock

What's at stake - There is no real obstacle if nothing is at stake. Survival is the most obvious, but least interesting of stakes. It offers nothing to step up to, nothing to continue riveting the interest and one tires of it rather quickly.
 
The trick to setting good stakes is to find out what is interesting to those involved in the conflict and make it about that. The scale can be intimate and personal or world changing, but all parties involved have to be invested in the outcome.

Failure is always an option in Tests, but should never be a dead end. There should be multiple ways to accomplish a task and failure may preclude one of them but never all.

If a character wants to tackle an obstacle that the GM feels is too big for one Test, then break it down into component parts and get the character's intent for each Test. This method can also be used to decompose Tests for which the character feels the obstacle is too high.
