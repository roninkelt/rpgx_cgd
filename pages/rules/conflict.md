Conflict occurs when a character doesnt want to do something, for reasons such as these:

* It would require them to question their assumptions
* It would require them to overcome an inner weakness.
* They promised someone they wouldnt do it.
* It would reveal their secrets to others.
* It would get their love interest or a family member in trouble.

What's at stake - There is no real conflict if nothing is at stake. Survival is the most obvious, but least interesting of stakes. It offers nothing to step up to, nothing to continue riveting the interest and one tires of it rather quickly.
 
The trick to setting good stakes is to find out what is interesting to those involved in the conflict and make it about that. The scale can be intimate and personal or world changing, but all parties involved have to be invested in the outcome.

Emotional - disrespect, humiliation
Physical - getting left behind, death, 
social - being ignored, losing face, credibility
