The basic mechanic is to build a pool of dice from the applicable Aptitude and Applications. That pool is rolled and any dice which are 6 or greater are deemed successes. The number of successes is compared to the Obstacle of the Test.

Successes which are also the dice\'s maximum value are rolled again. This continues as long as a die rolls it\'s maximum value, being said to explode.

Degree of Success is the number of successes over the obstacle of the test.
If the Degree is Zero, the test Succeeds, but a complication may be introduced.

##Unopposed Test
test a pool of dice against a fixed difficulty obstacle. 

If a character is strictly using Aptitudes and has no Application dice to add, then the difficulty doubles.

**Example Test Difficulties**
Difficulties are for for a character who performs the task on a regular basis. Picking a tumbler lock may be an expert task for the average person, but is routine for a character with skill in the task.

Target|Challenge
|---|:---:|
|One     |Simple
|Two     |Routine
|Three   |Difficult
|Four    |Expert
|Five    |Master
|Six     |Improbable
|Seven   |Spectacular
|Eight   |Heroic
|Nine    |Supernatural
|Ten     |Nearly Impossible
|Eleven  |Miraculous

##Opposed Test
Made when active opposition is involved in a Test. Opposing pools do not have to be composed similarly. Physical/Stealth - Wilderness vs Personal/Notice - Alertness is absolutely likely.  The Test Difficulty is modified by the number of dice in the opposition's pool by a factor of 3 dice to +1 Test Difficulty.


##Consumed Pool Test
Made when it is desirable to extend the roleplay time for a test. Alternately used when a task may be accomplished only with an extended investment of time, in which case each roll of the pool represents a certain amount of time.
