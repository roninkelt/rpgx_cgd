#Tests

This game requires a handful of 10 sided dice (d10), exactly how many depends on the setting in question - higher powered games require more dice.  References to die or dice are to the ten sided variety unless specifically noted otherwise.
 
The basic mechanic is to build a pool of dice from the applicable Aptitude, Applications and Motive. That pool is rolled and any dice which are 6 or greater are deemed successes. The number of successes is compared to the Test Obstacle (TO).

Successes which are also a 10 are rolled again being said to explode. This continues as long as the die continues to roll it's maximum value. 

Successful dice over the Test Obstacle are referred to as the test's Degree of Success, Degree or DoS. In many cases these excess dice may be used to shorten the amount of time taken or otherwise modify the circumstances of the Test's completion.

The Test Obstacle of a task may be modified depending upon time constraints or other changes to the normal difficulty of a task. Anything which puts pressure on the check may increase the Obstacle.

If a character is strictly using Aptitudes and has no Application dice to add, then the TO doubles.

Failure to exceed the Test Obstacle of a check doesn't necessarily mean that the character has failed, but that they may have a partial success or have the GM introduce a Complication - a development that increases the stakes and dramatic tension.

##Unopposed Test
This type of Test is against a fixed TO that depends exclusively on the difficulty of the task. 


**Example Test Difficulties**

Difficulties are for for a character who performs the task on a regular basis. Picking a tumbler lock may be an expert task for the average person, but is routine for a character with skill in the task. These difficulties assume a pool of 5-6 dice.

| Test Obstacle | Challenge |
| --- | :---: |
| One     | Simple
| Two     | Routine
| Three   | Difficult
| Four    | Expert
| Five    | Master
| Six     | Heroic
| Seven   | Improbable
| Eight   | Spectacular
| Nine    | Legendary
| Ten     | Supernatural
| Eleven  | Nearly Impossible
| Twelve  | Miraculous

##Opposed Test
Made when active opposition is involved in a Test. Opposing pools do not have to be composed similarly. Physical/Stealth - Wilderness vs Personal/Notice - Alertness is absolutely likely.  The Test Difficulty is modified by the number of dice in the opposition's pool by a factor of 3 dice to +1 Test Difficulty.


##Consumed Pool Test
Made when it is desirable to extend the roleplay time for a test. Alternately used when a task may be accomplished only with an extended investment of time, in which case each roll of the pool represents a certain amount of time.


#Success and failure:

The dice are a way of randomizing results, they can tell whether a player or gm action succeeds or fails

* Dire Failure
* Failure
* Success with complications (ties)
* Success
* Heroic Success

Granularity - one test per conflict or one test per stage of conflict for more important conflicts. 

Test when it matters. If there is no conflict and no stakes, no roll.

Don't dead end due to a failed test. There should always be multiple ways to approach a problem or resolve a conflict.
