The basic mechanic is to build a pool of dice from the applicable Aptitude and Applications. That pool is rolled and any dice which are 6 or greater are deemed successes. The number of successes is compared to the Target of the Test (TT).

Successes which are also the dice\'s maximum value are rolled again. This continues as long as a die rolls it\'s maximum value, being said to explode.

Degree of Success is the number of successes over the test target.  
If the Degree is Zero, the test Succeeds, but a complication may be introduced.  

##Unopposed Test
test a pool of dice against a fixed Test Target. 

If a character is strictly using Aptitudes and has no Application dice to add, then the Target doubles.

**Example Test Targets**  
Targets are for for a character who performs the task on a regular basis. Picking a tumbler lock may be an expert task for the average person, but is routine for a character with skill in the task. These challenge estimates assume that a pool is about 5 dice.

|Target|Challenge|
|---|:---:|
|One     |Simple
|Two     |Routine
|Three   |Difficult
|Four    |Expert
|Five    |Master
|Six     |Improbable
|Seven   |Spectacular
|Eight   |Heroic
|Nine    |Supernatural
|Ten     |Nearly Impossible
|Eleven  |Miraculous


##Opposed Test
Made when active opposition is involved in a Test. Opposing pools do not have to be composed similarly. Physical/Stealth - Wilderness vs Personal/Notice - Alertness is absolutely likely.  The Test Target is modified by the number of dice in the opposition's pool by a factor of 3 dice to +1 Test Target.


##Consumed Pool Test
Made when it is desirable to extend the roleplay time for a test. Alternately used when a task may be accomplished only with an extended investment of time, in which case each roll of the pool represents a certain amount of time. A consumed pool test can be either unopposed or opposed.

When a Test is made the pool is reduced by the Degree of Success of the Test. The notation for a consumed pool is Pool Size/Challenge (for example 10/3 - meaning that the pool has 10 dice and is Challenge 3(Difficult)
