#The Elements of Narrative in RPGs

RPG are a different narrative animal than books so there are different requirements

##Boundaries and the Social Contract
honest discussion about creative agenda   
types of conflict which are acceptable   
acceptable materials - RPGX is PG13 and all materials and conflicts should stay within those bounds.   
expectations for play - posting rate, post style, viewpoint   
How long is this going to take  - be specific.  

##Defining Conflicts & Stakes
obstacles - physical and mental   
stakes - what the characters want, what the npc's want, why they are in opposition and why it matters.    

##Threads
Threads are a question that raises conflict. Each thread needs oppositional forces, conflict and stakes. Some of these elements don't have to be obvious to the Players at the beginning.   

Every scenario should have a main thread - a question to be resolved through overcoming obstacles and resolving conflicts.   

a character thread is a specific question for the character. Each character should have several at any given time and each thread should be related to the main thread   

the narrative tree - start with the conflict at the trunk, let the players help develop and explore the branches   

Story Choice is feedback. The players give feedback via the choices they make in game, pay attention and home in on those things that they find interesting. Encourage meaningful choice as opposed to false choice, give players agency in the story.   

Each character should have several threads attached to them that illuminate various aspects of the main thesis and thread. That will keep them engaged and active.   

##Creating A Game
Talk to potential players about the big questions in the game. Have players talk to each other about characters and how they address these questions.   

setting isn't story   

thesis - deeper message or idea embedded in the game. Likely will never be explicit, but should be in the DM's awareness. Usually a word or short phrase.   

theme - motif established by reference and repeated language that reinforces thesis.   

A strong example is Star Trek: Wrath of Khan - the main thesis is vengance with subthreads of death, resurrection and ageing. The theme was Moby Dick - go and watch, you will see many of these things repeatedly referenced obliquely along with quotes and design elements from the book.   

###Scenes
Scene is one string of action in one location. Every Scene should advance story and every character should want and need something in each scene.   
    What is the main action of the scene?   
    What expectations for this interaction have been established beforehand?   
    What has been foreshadowed, is now the best time to use it?   
    How emotional is the setting?   
    Are there hints of a character's past?   
    Does subtext replace text as often as possible?   
    Does someone talk about something other than the plot?   

Questions for the GM -   
    How did the plot progress?   
    Which old questions were answered?   
    Which new questions are asked?    
    Is this a reversal or an escalation?   
    Is there reblocking -redefining old events in a new light?   
    Is there one touch? (push and pull)   
    Are there objects exchanged? (give and take)   

###Scenarios
A series of scenes with related action, purpose or opposition   

###Campaigns
a unified series of scenarios relating to the same thesis, theme and opposition.   

##Making Failure Awesome
Don't be afraid of failure. Sometimes heroes fail, and it highlights successes when players know that. On the other hand, failure ought not bring a story to a complete stop nor should it denigrate the player or character.   

There are several ways to make failure such that it doesn't deprotagonize the character and they still feel heroic and empowered.   

###Blame the Circumstances
The circumstances surrounding a test made it such that success was impossible.   

###Succeed at a Cost
Success happens, just not in the expected way or not without some cost or complication associated with it.   

###Your action, your description
The player narrates the failure, describing the how and why.   

##Habits of a Successful GM
These are what I consider integral habits of a successful storytelling GM. They definitely don't all apply to all games.   

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT - give players room to develop character. Highlight various characters and their unique traits with a moment to shine. Preferably at least one time per scene, and no less than once every other scene. Little moments are at least as important as large ones. Use flaws as often as positive traits.   

DISCIPLINE - not to be underestimated. Discipline in communication, content and boundaries. Be disciplined in communicating your story, encourage discipline in posting - separation of in character and out of character posting. Keep the game strictly within the bounds of allowable content. Don't allow players to chide or mock each other for in character actions. It is the GM's responsibility to make a space where players can become their character without fear. Encourage respect for integrity of both character and world. This is most definitely not a power trip for the GM, there is no faster way to break a game than to abuse discipline.   

MUSIC - a shortcut for adding emotion to your game. Whether it be a grooveshark playlist or some other method - find a way to get your players listening to music while they read and post. As a GM music is your best ally for setting an emotional tone.   

NPCS - vivid npcs bring the world to life. Each needs motive and method. they are the basis of the opposition forces and the main method the GM can use to effect change. A world without npcs is a dead world.   

PACE - keep things moving. If the pace starts to lag, introduce an obstacle. Eliminate what is unimportant to the theme or thread. Players don't want to spend time counting coins, bookkeeping or other activities that don't illuminate story or character. Players will emulate the GM, if he moves quickly, they will follow suit. 

PASSION - The GM should be passionate about what they are doing. Players will reflect the intensity of the GM, if he expects nothing, they will give nothing and the game will wither.   

STORY - Develop a compelling premise, but don't try to force outcomes. Story is the basis of the game and gives players a platform to develop the role that they want to play.   

SURPRISES - give players what they want, but not the way they expect it. Don't be predictable. Turns and reverses also keep interest high.   

YES AND - emphasize that everyone should accept what has been asserted before rather than negating it. Negation is a full stop while adding on builds momentum and trust between players and GM. Despite this, all should keep in mind and respect the integrity of both the game world and characters. This goes hand in hand with not having a determined outcome in mind, but rather a conflict and process.   

##Stance and the RPG experience
A few words here on my experience and beliefs of what makes a good and intense roleplaying experience. 

Immersion - the sense of experiencing an RPG as if it were 'real'. When a player acts and reacts as if they are in the shared imagined space constructed by the game interaction.
Character Stance - when a player experiences and describes what their character is doing as a fictional construct separate from themselves.
Actor Stance - the state of experience when a player is acting as the character would act without conscious consideration of the character as being separate from the player.

In d20 little consideration is given to the motivation of the player versus the character. Characters are the extension of the player into the game world, and they generally have the same motivations as the player - to overcome the obstacles in front of them as presented by the GM. In my experience that is fulfilling intellectually but not very emotionally engaging. Playing becomes an exercise in puzzle solving whether it be a tactical solution, actual puzzle or trap. There is little consideration given to the character as having independent motivations, goals or experiences from the player.

I'm going to encourage Actor Stance as a method of achieving game immersion and elevating the intensity of the experience.

speak in first person


players play themselves and compete against the dm and other players.... thats fine and wonderful but that quickly hits a ceiling emotionally.... for a dm and a game and players to truly experience something they should look at this art as performance... they are actors... the dm is the director... it would do well for all involved to take a class on acting.... full immersion
