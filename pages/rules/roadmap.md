#4 Questions
##Who is this for
Players and GM\'s of Forum Games

##What do they care about
An immersive roleplaying experience  that maximizes the strengths of Forum Games and minimizes the weaknesses.

##How do we deliver it
A simple rules framework available under a permissive license

##Why do it
There is currently no ruleset optimized for forum games that takes advantage of the format's strengths (character development, detailed storybuilding) and minimizes it's weaknesses (slow turnaround time, characters and gm's who drop with no warning)
