##How do we deliver it
A simple rules framework available under a permissive license

##Why do it
There is currently no ruleset optimized for forum games that takes advantage of the format's strengths (character development, detailed storybuilding) and minimizes it's weaknesses (slow turnaround time, characters and gm's who drop with no warning)

* Optional rules are fine but mark them clearly.
* Stick to the facts in the main text - discussion and examples go in sidebars
* Avoid elaborating on part of the system which is not core to the concept.
* Do not add anything to the RPG that is not going to enhance the concept. 
* do not include design process in with the rules.
* No design discussion in the rules document.


Trial by Questioning
Answer each of the following questions. Do not proceed until you know all the answers.

    What will the players do?
    What is fun about it?
    Why am I designing it?
    Who will play it?
    What do I want to do with it?
    Are you going to publish it in print on demand?
    Is it suitable for Campaigns or One-Shots?
    What's its closest rival and how is it different?

What style of game will it be?
It is not important to tie down exactly the style of play the game will engender but it will help you decide whether or not to include something later one. On each of the graphs below, put a spot where you would like your game to be.

Co-operation
Players co-operate 	Players compete
Shared resources 	Individual resources

Mechanics
Rules for everything 	General rules
No dice 	Lots of dice
Easy to die 	Hard to kill

Character creation
Random (quick) 	Point buy (slower)
Choose from a list 	Players make it up
Rapidly changing characters 	Static characters (no advancement)

Tactical
Grids + miniatures 	Scrawled piece of paper
Precision measurements 	Purely descriptive

Style
Personal quest 	World changing consequences
Humourous 	Serious
Realistic 	Cinematic

Pitch it
In the future, a GM is going to pitch the game to a group of players. The act of pitching will force you to more tightly define what it is you are trying to achieve. If you discover that you are repeating yourself a lot, then this is a good thing, it means that you have a tightly defined idea of what the game is about. Do all of these pitching activities:

    Describe your game in 5 words.
    Elevator pitch, describe your game verbally in 12 seconds. Keep trying until you can.
    Create a marketing blurb that you might read on a post. No more than 25 words, no less than 12.
    Draw an advert for your game on a bit of paper.

=======
What to make mechanics for

Only make mechanics for things you want the players to do in game. Some typical ones are:

Character creation
The creation of a character sets the benchmark against which everything in the world is judged.

Unopposed actions
The character interacting with the world alone are actions. These include riding a horse, sailing and navigation. In these cases, there is no-one opposing the character, its just the character against the world. These actions will be performed a lot.

Opposed actions
Where a character is trying to do something and another character is trying to stop them. These include persuading an NPC to open the gate to the castle. A character is trying to get the NPC to do something and the NPC's sense of duty is opposing it.

Combat
Combat can come in may different forms: unarmed, with close quarters weapons, ranged, vehicle, space craft and so on. Combat also should have a method of doing harm to the opponent. This can be the same mechanic as an opposed action. Combat is usually broken up into rounds where each character takes it in turn to do an action.

Help the players make quick choices and keep the game moving by presenting the choices in a combat action clearly. The player can then spend their thinking time working out what their character would do rather than what options there are.

Wounding and healing
Invulnerable characters are less interesting to play than vulnerable ones. Have a mechanic to keep track of how much hurt the character has been through and how much more they can take before they can take no more actions. Having a decreasing point value (Hit Points) is a traditional solution but you can also choose narrative effects that affect the player's decisions. Taking damage might also incur a penalty to performing actions. Ensure you include a way for the characters to heal too.

Lethality
Measure lethality as the amount of game time it takes for a healthy character to die with average weapons/equipment in an average fight. Is lethality so high that the player will never get a chance to retreat? If that's not part of your concept then consider changing it.

Performing "Magic"
Magic (or doing technical actions in modern/Sci Fi) does not need its own system but you can add novel flavour to your system with it. Ensure that the magic system related to the setting - a society based on magic being easy should not have a system where runes need to be drawn accurately over several turns.

Controlling the narrative
Controlling the narrative means that the players get to decide the outcome of things.

Character improvement
If the roleplaying game is designed to be run over a series of sessions, then it is important to hand out a reward that can be used to improve the character.

Character Creation
Character creation is the cornerstone of any system. Do not stint on it. A prospective GM might well make a few characters to see what it is like. Ensure it is slick, majestic and well described. For the players, it is the first time they will interact with your game and it is important that the process is well explained. Character creation does not need to be quick, some players enjoy an involved creation session, especially if the character will last through a long campaign. Be true to the concept you laid out.

Characters tend to made of some or all of the following parts:

    Attributes - a fixed number of inherent abilities of the character. Include: Strength, Intelligence and so on.
    Skills - a list of learnt abilities, often picked from a list in the setting.
    Feats/Traits - extraordinary abilities that the general populace do no possess, these can be both disadvantageous too.
    Health - a way of tracking the amount of damage the character can take before they fall over.
    Fluff - description, character name, organisations they belong to, age or anything pertinent. It's the only place in the RPG where fluff is acceptable and prompts the player to flesh out the character.

If you want the game to be learnt quickly, try and keep to familiar terms. If your game is more epic in scale, feel free to break out the Thesaurus and pick words more familiar to your genre.

Avoid adding one of the above unless there is a rule that makes use of it. If you have a 'Psyonic strength' ability and no psyonic rules then the Attribute will be useless.

Ensure you include an example character creation, explaining the choices made at each point.

Random roll vs Point assign
Most roleplaying games use either random roll, point assign or a combination of the two (sum the rolls of 10 dice and assign). Random roll mechanics lead to faster character generation but can leave the player with a character they didn't want to play. Point assign creation tends to be slower, leads to optimisation but leaves the player with the character they think they want to play.

Backstory creation
Flow charts or randomly rolled tables can be used to create the backstory of your characters. Some players might find it too restrictive, others liberating. If you include one these mechanisms, I recommend it is optional.

Collaborative creation
Some character creation mechanisms use play a way of creating a character. In these collaborative methods, players play out scenes. The outcomes of those scenes determine or modify the facets of the character.

Types of mechanics
There are an enormous number of variants of dice, resource and narrative mechanic. Below are just a taste of four of the simplest mechanics many systems build upon. Most roleplaying games depend on mechanics using character properties (attributes and skills) combined with a random element.

Target number

    Used for: Unopposed actions, Opposed actions, combat, magic
    Format: Character Properties + Modifiers + Dice roll >= Target number

A target number mechanic is the simplest form of mechanic. A Character's Properties are combined (such as the sum of appropriate Attribute and Skill) with modifiers and a die roll. The result is then compared to a target number that is set by the Gamesmaster. In most cases, the higher the target number, the more difficult the task. For opposed rolls, the target number is a roll of the opponent. This can be slower as two dice are rolled, two equations summed before the comparison can be done.

As long as the properties are kept in low digits, the calculations are easy. Avoid applying too may modifiers. Some systems use tables to set the target numbers, this improves simulation of the mechanic but can be slow.Speed can be maintained by having the result of some calculations written on a character sheet. These are sometimes written down as secondary statistics.

Pros

    Easy to balance
    Quick
    Versatile

Cons

    Linear probability scale
    Mathematics can be difficult with large numbers
    There is a temptation to add many modifiers elsewhere (such as modifiers on weapons)
    Does not foster communication at the table

Meta Gaming?
This is not Meta Gaming because the rolling of dice represents the actual actions of the character.

Dice pool

    Used for: Unopposed actions, Opposed actions, combat, magic
    Format: Roll as may dice as you have in character properties, remove dice for modifiers, count the number of dice that roll over a given number. To succeed, you need a number of successes.

Dice pool mechanics rely on counting the number of dice that successfully roll over a number. This can be a length process when you are rolling 20 dice but the mathematics remains simple because you are not performing additions or subtractions. Modifiers are applied by removing dice (either before or after the roll).

Pros

    Quick
    Modifiers do not involve maths
    Versatile
    Feels good to heft cupped hands full of dice

Cons

    Can need a lot of dice
    Counting can take longer than comparing a single number
    Balance is more tricky
    Does not foster communication at the table
    Probability of success more difficult to estimate than for target number rolls

Meta Gaming?
This is not Meta Gaming because the rolling of dice represents the actual actions of the character.

Resource Pool

    Used for: Boosting actions, controlling the narrative
    Format: Character has a pool of points that they can spend when required

Resource pools reduce the randomness in your game by giving the player a tactical choice whether to spend the points from their pool or save them for later. This mechanic is sometimes used to allow the player to control the narrative. It can also be used to re-roll dice, boost outcomes.

Pros

    Gives the player an tactical choice
    Simple to understand
    Player feels an element of control
    Fosters communication at the table

Cons

    Slower than dice rolling
    Balance difficult

Meta Gaming?
Resources management tends to be a Meta Gaming task because it is not the character who is spending a point to boost an action, or taking hold of the narrative. The player is the one that is deciding to spend the pool point. If you use a resource pool for something that the character controls (such as a magical pool of energy) then this is not a Meta Game mechanic.

Voting

    Used for: Controlling the narrative
    Format: Players vote on the outcome

Voting reduces the randomness of outcomes by putting those back into the hands of the players. Some voting mechanisms are used with resource pools so that players have to use their votes tactically. Voting can be secret or public. This mechanic can add a level of competition at the table, make sure that fits in with the concept of your game.

Pros

    Gives the players more control
    Adds tension and atmosphere to the table
    Fosters communication at the table

Cons

    Slower than dice rolling
    Slows the pace of the whole game if used liberally
    Secret voting even slower!

Meta Gaming?
This is a Meta Game mechanic. Players voting on outcomes is detached from the characters themselves.

Crunch
Crunch is the name given to the feeling that there are a lot of rules to remember to play the game. You should try and strike a balance between a simple system where the tactical decisions are quick and a crunchy system where there are lots of options, modifiers and special rules. Too few rules and you're giving the player fewer tactical options, there is less game system to manipulate. Too many options and the system becomes overwhelming. Lite rules tend to be quicker to player whereas crunchy rules do a better job of representing the game world. Only you can decide whether the system fits the concept you decided on at the start.

Crunch often creeps into a system in the form of special rules for spells, monsters or equipment. These extra rules might look innocuous on their own but when the GM tries to apply all the caveats from different parts of the rules then the game grinds to a halt.

##Settings
Novel settings are best described from a top down point of view. Begin with the major themes of the game and how they interact. Try and keep the themes limited in number and intertwined. Expand on each of the themes, adding only detail that the GM or players might need to play. Stop when you have described the parts of your setting that the player characters directly interact with. Unless going to the toilet is something the player characters will be asked to do a lot, do not describe it. World building is a huge topic, which is very dependent on the genre of RPG you are creating. Here are some general tips:

    Make the world exciting. If the world is mundane, there will be no desire to explore it.
    Ensure that organisations, Gods, nations, NPCs are in conflict with others. Give them opposed goals and motivations. This conflict will make your world more interesting.
    Before you start writing, list all the aspects you want in the setting and then list the things you do not.
    Give the characters something to do that is interesting.
    Avoid absolutes - it is better to say that there are few Gnomes left after the Gnomageddon rather than none at all.
    Assume that if you include a location, the players will try to go there. If you include an NPC, assume that they will shoot it in the face.
    From top-down, you don't have to draw the whole map or include all the races, you're only specifying the big themes.
    Give your places, organisations and NPCs more than one weakness. A single weakness can be difficult for players to spot.
    If providing a broad description, use an adjective. 'On a mountain' is less inspiring than 'On a craggy mountain'. Big list of adjectives

What to include

Only the minimum description needed to meet the themes you specified in your concept. When defining the concept you defined a number of themes (such as dangerous magic, continents at war or space federations) start by describing these themes. When describing a theme, begin with what is known from the general populace's point of view then add information that the heroic characters would know. Here is a list of entities you might wish to include:

Locations   
Locations should act as seeds for adventures as well as the places they take place. If you cannot think of a good plot or reason a player might want to go there then don't include it. To create a location:

    Begin with the geography and an adjective. 
    Provide an overview mention of its architecture (broadly).
    Describe its prominent (or extraordinary) features. 
    Give the purpose of the place. Why does it exist? Who made it? Why should there be a village there? What purpose does it serve? 
    Give the place a name. 


People and races
Describe the people living in your world. These will make up the majority of who your player characters will interact with. Add flavour to your setting by introducing different races with physiology, philosophy and wisdom. Racial differences do not need to be large and can be the source of great prejudice. With prejudice comes conflict, which in turn makes setting more interesting.

    Keep the player characters role in the setting in mind. Are they the good guys or bad? Are they made up from the different race or all one?

Organisations
This is a generic name given to groups of NPCs that work together. An Organisation might be the inhabitants of a place who share a common goal or a secret society.

    Aim: what do they want to achieve?
    Resources: What resources do they have at their disposal? Use general terms such as 'Can influence the creation of law.' rather than 'Has 4 councillors under payment'.
    Public knowledge: What will the characters know about the organisation?
    Reach: Do they operate only in the city or countrywide, across a continent or throughout the galaxy?
    Activities: What do the organisation get up to? What do they not do? How do they raise cash?
    Allies and Enemies: Who are the organisation friends with, who do they hate? How do they interact, is is subtle or openly hostile?

Flora and Fauna
Plants and animals breathe life into setting. Focus on a few typical and atypical types. Avoid creating an entire ecosystem - just detail ones that the players are likely to interact with. Choose some plants and animals and give them a twist to make them different. Then decide how they interact with each other. Include a Bestiary 

Pantheon
If gods figure in your setting be sure to describe them by what they do and why they are venerated. Long back stories and history are only interesting to Classics scholars.

Common or well known NPCs
Kings, Lords, famous heroes, arch villains, well known craftsmen, heads of guilds, merchants can all add to a setting's depth. Don't forget that if you include an NPC, you should expect someone to shoot it in the face. For an NPC to be interesting, they must have a goal, stereotypes are fine but the goal must be easy for the GM to understand. The complexity will come when the game is played. Make sure you include at least two NPCs that have conflicting goals. It is through conflict that interesting stories are formed.

Geography
A map is a useful tool to show the scope and scale of the play area. Concentrate detail to one area of the map rather than spreading it out, you should give the GM somewhere well described to start their campaign and yet allow plenty of area for them to expand.

Recent History
Include large events in the recent history, particularly if they explain why the world is the way it is. Try and include a couple of events in the recent couple of weeks that would effect everyone or that would signal that there is going to be a big change. Recent History can be useful for the GM to create plot hooks.

GM Information
Give the GM some extra details on the places you mentioned. Help the GM create adventures by providing plot hook ideas by posing "What if..." questions. Explain how you intend the setting to be used and what themes you had in mind when you designed. You need to be explicit because it is difficult for a prospective GM to understand the nuances of a new setting through the text.

Sample Adventure
A sample adventure should showcase the novel parts of the setting (and system) and demonstrate why the GM should run the game. The sample adventure should be aimed at starting characters so that the GM can run the adventure straight off. Keep the adventure simple to achieve and include some combat or excitement. 


Testing

Your game needs to be tested before it¿s devoured by the general public. Testing ranges from simple mechanics tests all the way through to a full blow campaign play test. If you do not have a group to test with and cannot find a kind group to test it for you, there is still testing that can be done. Testing takes a long time, be prepared for this step to take as long as the rest of the game design.

If you are following the "Release Small, Release Often" principle (described in the next Chapter) then ensure you state clearly that the game has not been tested when you perform releases.
Smoke Test
A smoke test ensures that the system won¿t catch fire when you try to use it. It will only find glaring holes, not mechanic niggles (see Mechanic Edge Cases) To smoke test the game, do the following:

    Make 10 characters.
    Write out 4 full combats step by step. Write out what everyone says and does and draw a battle map of what happens. Ensure each combat is different from your rule examples.
    Find a non-gamer to read through the whole game to check for grammar and spelling.
    Update the table of contents and index.
    Check your table of contents and index by randomly picking 6 items from each, located at different places in the book and check the pages are correct.
    Make sure that images are near the text that talks about them.
    Print out some test pages, is it too dark or too light? Is the font large enough? If you're using a background image, does it obscure the text?
    Ask a friend in a different country to print out on a different size, if you're in the US, try A4. If you're elsewhere, use US Letter.
    How does it look on screen? If a friend has a tablet device, check it on there too. If not, ask the internet, a friendly RPG geek will check it out for you.

Read it again
But before you read it again, check back to the style section of Chapter 3 then read through the entire game, contents, index, everything. Make notes as read through go, do not stop to edit. Check all the captions on the images and headings on the tables. If you are linking sections of the document together (in HTML or PDF) then click every link. You might be sick of your game by now but this is a very important step, so do it. Then ask yourself these questions:

    Does it fit the concept I was aiming for? Go back to when you wrote it down in Chapter 1 and check each item off.
    If it does not, have I still made something worth playing?
    Does it feel like the genre I am trying to represent?
    Did I solve the mechanic problems I was trying to solve?
    What¿s best about the game?
    What¿s worst about the game?
    Can I add any more images to spruce it up?
    Is all the information I need on the Character sheet?

Trim
You¿ve used too many words to describe your game. It is normal to do that, your brain is not wired for brevity when it is describing concepts. Cut down every paragraph to its bare form. Is it still intelligible? If so, keep it that way. Your second draft should be 10% shorter than the first.
Mechanic Edge Cases
The success of a mechanics system can be judged on its ability to still operate when under stress. You can stress test your system by seeing what happens when the parameters are at their limits. You cannot test all possible edge cases (especially when it comes to combinations of spells) but you can certainly pick some example worst/best case situations.
For example, if the mechanic is combat what happens when a character has maximum strength, the best weapon, highest skill, excellent armour and so on. Do you have a monster that will challenge a character like that? How many rounds will it take to kill a character like that with medium monsters? How many medium monsters will it take?
A team of 5 people all firing guns that have been upgraded 5 times should be able to kill a monster in 5 combat turns. "Upgraded 5 times" guns do 5 damage, that's 25 damage a turn. So a normal monster should have 125 hit points. Basic characters have weapons that do 1 damage will take a staggering 25 combat turns.
Ask yourself these sorts of questions for all the mechanics, paying particular attention to modifiers and special items. A sword might have a reasonable power but may unbalance the system when enchanted by more than one spell. If you find that it is difficult to find edge cases with your mechanics then perhaps the system is too complex and consider simplifying it. Spreadsheets can be useful for testing out the range of dice roles and probabilities but do not forget the affects of special powers or feats on the numbers.
Imaginary game
A good way to test your game is to run an imaginary game. Take 4 of the 10 characters you created earlier and then run through your example setting and adventures. Ensure the characters have goals that fit your setting, is it easy or difficult to create goals that are possible. Try all of the mechanics, use the characters to defeat the monsters without using your imagination (by grinding) and using imagination. During your game, try and answer the following questions:

    What is the quickest way to end an encounter?
    What is the best combination of skills, spells, weapons and equipment to solve each encounter?
    Is there anything missing from the starting character setups that make the game impossible?
    Is it fun?

Play Testing
Play testing is the act of playing the game to see if it meets your concept. It¿s important to remember that a play test isn¿t really a normal game. Most GMs will bend rules, ignore sections and only use 50% of a ruleset in ten sessions worth of a play. A good play test should be precisely by the rules and use as much of the ruleset as possible. You should reward the playtesters with a credit in the front of the book, or a signed copy if you are feeling flush. Make sure that your playtest group is made up of your target audience (see Chapter 1). You should playtest only when you feel the game is complete, playtesting should not be used as a tool for design, only for verification.
Playtest Pack
A playtest pack is a ready-to-go pack of information that makes it easy for the playtest group to test your game and provide feedback. To get the best from the group running your game for the first few times, you must provide additional support. When compiling your playtest pack, you can do so assuming that the player knows roleplaying games well. It should include:

    A form for the player to put their name and contact details on. Give them the opportunity to opt-out of being included in the book credits.
    A one page rule summary detailing the main mechanics.
    Character sheets. Both blank and pre-generated. Although character creation should be part of the playtest, the players may not have the luxury of making a character.
    A sample adventure that makes use of as many of the mechanics as possible.
    A feedback form (see below).
    A summary of what is required by the playtesters.
    A Non Disclosure agreement (NDA) - optional as this is a free game after all.
    Your contact details for the player to leave with.

Feedback
It is important to get feedback from everyone who plays the game. Feedback forms are the simplest way to garner information but if possible socialising with the group in a relaxed atmosphere (in a pub/bar) is a good way to dig into details. Players more likely to focus on the good things if confronted but at least you can question about particular mechanics this way. Have your notebook with you when talking to play testers, write down their good ideas then and there. Do not trust your memory to remember the details. The playtesters won't mind, they will appreciate their point of view is important.
Feedback Forms
Your feedback form is there for you to gauge whether or not you have managed to satisfy your concept. Player/GM fun is important too but it is important to note that not all players like new systems at first and the act of learning them can be tiring and less fun. You can provide two sorts of questions, check box ones and written replies. I would recommend having both as play testing can be tiring and lengthy prose without inspiration from pointed questions can be difficult. Here are some example questions:

Questions to be used with tick boxes under the headings "Strongly agree, Agree, No preference, Disagree, Strongly Disagree"

    The game's rules are too light
    The game's system feels like [game's genre]
    The setting feels different to other games
    I understood the rules
    The game looks good
    I was surprised that the game was free
    I would play this game again

Questions to be used with plenty of space to reply.

    What I liked about the game was...
    What I disliked about the game was...
    What I thought was missing was...

What to do with feedback
All feedback is valuable, not all of it is useful. For each of the forms and notes you have made, assign them a priority and then use your concept to check to see if you feel the feedback is useful. Concentrate on the problems that are raised rather than the solutions that the players offer. As the game designer, you are the expert. Mechanics changes will mean restarting your mechanics testing (easier if you have used a spreadsheet). Be prepared that not everyone will like your game. Thank them for the feedback but do not dwell on it.
When to stop play testing
Play testing must end when you feel that the game meets the concept you originally set out. Play testing cannot be used to find every rules hole and it is possible to play test too much. Too much play testing is procrastination, pick an end date and finish your game.
Post play test release
Ensure that you schedule time after your play test is over to update the rules and put out another release of your game. Do not make the playtesters feel that you have wasted their time by sitting on the changes for a year.
