Supporting characters (NPCs) are real characters, just partially seen. 

They have their own wants, needs, problems etc.

This is the process that I use to make them real and thus make the game world real. Without real supporting characters, the players will have no immersion or sense of the reality of the game world. Minor supporting characters need a name and motive. Those with larger roles should get the complete treatment.

Name everyone.

Give them a logline, self interests, a problem, a solution and a conflict between those things. They also need limitations, complications, a greatest fear and description. 

The first step toward making your NPCs real is to name them. Make or find a list of setting appropriate names and use it. Give every NPC who gets lines or on-screen action a name. Supporting character names also set the tone for the players when they name their characters.

The logline is a statement that wraps motive, problem and solution in one simple statement. It is who the character is - it encapsulates all that makes them who they are. Keep it in mind whenever they are speaking or acting in any way. If they are acting contrary to this, there had better be a overwhelmingly compelling reason. It indicates the conflict between the problem and solution. 

The supporting cast also need straightforward, sensible self-interests. Most NPCs are uncomplicated and fairly straightforward. They do what they are motivated to do, when they want to do it, and if something gets in their way, they deal with it. Most times folks follow their immediate interests - hunger, thirst, love, lust, revenge, maliciousness, pride, vanity, security. Those are the things most of us listen to in our day to day actions and what your supporting cast should as well. 

The problem is the reason that they exist in this story. This is a character problem, not a plot problem - this is why they are taking action. It can be as simple as a shopkeep who is short of sales this month and needs to make rent

They need a solution to the problem just stated and some conflict between the two. Remember that these are character problems and not plot problems. 

The npc should also have limitations of one sort or another that relate to the problem and solution.

A little description is good - keep it to 100 words and don't try to cover everything. You want to give an impression then let your imagination fill in the rest. Find the things that make the character unique, interesting odd or different.

NPCs do things and say stuff, that's how they create plot. Plot is the result of characters being characters. The supporting characters have an essential part in this.

Make PC - NPC -PC triangles and make your supporting cast even more human by making sure that their uncomplicated self-interests involve the players characters individually. Show different sides of their personalities to the various players characters based on what they want or need from that character. 

Take them for a test drive - write a bit of quick dialog with other characters. See what they are capable of. Then if they need it revise the logline until it reflects who they are.

Now every time a supporting character contributes to the story, you can say why.  This may seem like a lot of work, but good characters and a realistic world are worth it. Characters are like icebergs - you may only ever see a tenth of the berg, but that doesn't mean that the rest isn't there and affecting everything that happens on the surface.
