#Character Motives

All characters possess four Motive Attributes, each defining some touchstone for the character's current circumstance.

Motives give your character the will, drive, and determination to accomplish and succeed when they are pursuing them, driving the narrative and the going gets tough. As such they should be powerful and clear, with a call to action inherent as well as some sort of dramatic conflict.

Motives may also be rewritten and reconsidered or cast in a new light as the game continues. They are not meant to remain static. They are intended to grow and change - to be strengthened, weakened, resolved or broken. All things which are rewarded. 


##Defining Motives

Types of motives

1. Goals

An easy Motive to write is a goal.  Usually this works if there is a concrete situation, a defined tension, that is known to exist during character creation. You know about a key of the game in advance and can integrate that into your character build.

Goal-based Motives can produce two very different kinds of conflicts.  The simplest is raw challenge - the GM presents challenges to be overcome on the way to achieving the goal.  The second conflict is one of internal choices: just how far are you willing to go and what will you sacrifice in pursuit of the goal - ideals, relationships, other goals?

2. Relationships

Relationships as Motives are a great source of tension.  At the simplest, a relationship can be threatened by cutting off characters from contact - imprisonment, kidnapping, or death.  Alternately and sometimes more significantly, a relationship is threatened by loss of trust, resentment, misunderstanding, and more.

If the relationship is a negative one from the start, then the tension can come from how you deal with it in spite of social pressure that makes it something you can't simply walk away from or end without a lot of trouble.

Relationships as Motives can mean conflicts of having bad things happen to the people you care about, struggling to maintain the good will, or else having ties to bad people.

Relationship Motives should have an element of tension to them. Something that motivates the character to take action. 

3. Ideals

Ideals are principles, beliefs, oaths, codes of conduct or values the character holds dear. There should be some conflict between the demands of this type of belief and the other beliefs that the character holds, forcing the character to make hard choices.

4. Self Doubt or Fear

Self doubt is a great Motive tool and point for character development.  It may have multiple layers of meaning - a Motive about what your character fears (correctly or incorrectly) and/or a Motive about what the character subconsciously acts on, but hasn't consciously acknowledged yet.

5. Destiny

The character may or may not be aware that they have some sort of destiny about them, something toward which their whole life is building.

##Using Motives

Motives are a player's way of letting everyone know what it is that they want the game to be about so be sure that's actually what you want the game to be about.

If you write something that doesn't motivate you, then the game is likely not going to be in your interest. Likewise, also realize that Motives you choose are where conflict will happen and that the outcome is in doubt.  Should there be an aspect of your character that is not in doubt, don't make it a Motive. 

In addition motives are the method of advancing your character. By doing things that they care about, you gain points to spend on increasing  Applications and Aptitudes. That will be discussed more in [Running the Game](Running the Game/index.html).

##Adjusting Motives

As players get a better handle of their characters and their place within the world they will want to adjust and change Motives.  Initial Motives that you thought were going to be interesting, turn out to not have been once you start playing and you figure out what is actually interesting. Some Motives may get wording adjusted, refining conflicts you want to see. Others may get replaced with something altogether different and more interesting. 

This process is important as it helps redirect play to what is most interesting for the group as a whole.

In addition Motives may be replaced as they are satisfied or fulfilled. When a character achieves a goal, fulfills an oath or in any other way renders a Motive irrelevant or otherwise uninteresting, the player must spend the points attached to that Motive then rewrite to suit.

##Motives as a tool for character growth

Consider the option taking Motives that are simple minded or just plain wrong, with the purpose of making a narrative arc of your character growing beyond them.

##Contrasting characters with Motives

it may be self evident, but two otherwise identical characters can have a completely different feel based on Motive.



GM Notes - need to relocate to another page ***


opposing Motives (The system must be destroyed!, We can fix things through reform!).  different Motives that are perpendicular, rather than directly opposing.  For example, one character is hellbent on revenge, the other character is sworen to see to the safety of the first character.  It's not directly opposing, but there are plenty of places where there is conflict.

The Trap of Non-Motives

Motives seem redundant, can't I just look at where the player puts the most skill/stat points, that will tell me what they want out of a game.

A player may choose to give a character awesome sword skill for any of the following reasons:

- They want to get into sword fights as a focus of play

- They really don't like sword fights, but putting a lot of points there means it will be over quickly when it happens.

- They expect the game to be lethal, and are afraid if they don't put points into sword skills, their character will die.

- It fits the concept of their character but they don't actually ever expect to use it much.

Only one of the above involves wanting that conflict, the other three don't want that conflict at all.  This is why stats and scores are not necessarily useful and why explicit Motive mechanics are needed.

Beware the Roach Motive - One which when the spotlight shines on a character they use that Belief to scuttle for the shadows -- away from conflict. If you as a GM see one, do not ask the player to rewrite it. Instead challenge the hell out of it. Use the other Motives of the character to corner them into taking action. Be merciless in this.

Red flags to look out for:

      - If players don't know what their characters are supposed to be doing, their Motives aren't urgent enough.
      - If players aren't earning at least 1 point per session, their Motives need to be redefined or the GM must reexamine the conflicts they are presenting.
      - If a character hasn't redefined at least one Motive due to progress in understanding or accomplishment within 2 games, their Motives lack urgency or have no call to action.  

Two good tips for Motives:

        Every character should have a Motive that can be resolved in the next Arc, and a Belief that will never really be solved. Players should be getting rewards for resolving Motives and for pursuing Motives.
        There should be an inner conflict built into Motives. The GM should be able reward one for going against type every other Arc.
