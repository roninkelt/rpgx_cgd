I've spent some time thinking about the game and like much of what is in the forum here, but found myself asking - what makes it unique or uniquely suited to forum games?  Why would someone use this system as opposed to one of the other thousand face to face game systems that are available?

Not to denigrate the thinking here, but my answer so far is - 'nothing'. What we've got is a good game foundation, but it works just like many of the others out there.  So to that end, I've come up with a couple of wild ass ideas that emphasize story, scene structure and cooperative play. They may stink, but let me present them anyway.

One - each scene the characters donate a number of dice from their character to a scene pool which is used by everyone to resolve actions. The GM adds dice to the pool when bidding to complete his actions and the players remove dice to do the same. The scene pool is fixed at the beginning of every scene and the total number of dice for an act (a number of scenes that build to a story point) is based on the characters involved. The scene pool will generally build as dice are added and subtracted based on character and gm actions and the pool rolls over from scene to scene.  A large pool would represent lots of tension and unresolved desires, while a small pool generally would represent a lull in the story.

Two - each character bases the success or failure of their actions on the roll of the character before them. What this means is that the prior post would draw dice from another character (doesn't matter which one as long as it's not their own) and throw a pool for the next action. The next character to post would use that roll as the basis for their action and then do the same thing - draw dice from another and carry on.  This would speed action by not requiring a character to wait for the result of rolls before continuing on.

BTW - still digesting the stuff above, but wanted to get this posted while it was still fresh in mind.
