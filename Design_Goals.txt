Design Goals:
Speed of play
non-flat probability curve for resolution mechanic
focus on story and drama/excitement
rules simplicity and flexibility
skills based vs levels based
character abstracted from player
rewards based on character motive
focussed on PbP play but applicable to tabletop as well.
