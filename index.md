A statement of the principles we will be using to guide the game design.

* focused on PbP play but applicable to tabletop as well.
* modular settings (setting not wrapped into core system)
* speed of play
* non-flat probability curve for resolution mechanic
* focus on story, conflict and dynamic interaction (drama/excitement)
* rules simplicity and flexibility
* skills based vs levels based
* character abstracted from player
* rewards based on character motive, and narrative progress
* broadly competent characters
* characters are easy to damage but hard to kill
* immediate rewards
* story agency for all players
* GM free mode of play
* "yes and" narrative mode

Success modes:

* Dire Failure
* Failure
* Success with complications (ties)
* Success
* Heroic Success
