Book I contains everything you need to play the absolute core of the game, including task resolution and character creation. 

Book II escalates this, including the rules for Full Contests, as well as Melee and Ranged combat sequences. 

Book III includes all of the additional optional rules for fighting giant beasts, customizing weapons, and other topics. 

Book IV is the province of the Game Master, and includes the rules for generating NPCs and running games in the Â‘Bastards style player-driven narrative.
